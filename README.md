# Angular Weather  

This is my simple project for diving back into angular.  
I used this to learn rxjs and making custom pipes.

Uses http requests, observables, managing promises, switchmap, and a 3rd party weather api. Also made a custom pipe, which sucks but displays the return json data okay enough.
